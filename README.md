# Handwritten Digits Classification

We Implemented The 3 Layer CNN to classify the handritten digits from 0-9, with
a success rate of 96.8%. 

## Guidelines for Running the Code
For Training the model:


- Save the training data with the name X\_train.npy & label as y\_train.npy

- Run train.py using command python train.py

For predicting unknown digits using saved model or for testing the saved model:

- Save the testing data with the name X\_test.npy & label as Y\_test.npy


- Run test.py using command python test.py
